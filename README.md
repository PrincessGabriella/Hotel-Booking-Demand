# Hotel-Booking-Demand

This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel from Kaggle. It is originally from the article written by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Vol. 22, 2019.

## Background

Hotel Booking Demand The hospitality sector offers diverse accommodation experiences that cater to various types of travelers. City hotels, often situated within vibrant urban centers, blend modern amenities with local charm, providing travelers with easy access to historic neighborhoods, landmarks, and cultural hotspots. For instance, City Hotel in Lisbon allows guests to enjoy modern comfort amidst iconic sites and bustling markets, appealing to those exploring urban landscapes. Meanwhile, resort hotels, typically located in scenic coastal regions like the Algarve, offer serene escapes that emphasize relaxation and outdoor adventure, drawing travelers in search of leisure and scenic beauty.

Hotels generate revenue from guests who stay and spend on additional services provided by the hotel. Howeve c cancellations are inevitable. When cancellations occur too frequently, they can pose a significant challenge for t e hotel. Excessive cancellations prevent the hotel from reaching its full income potential.

Business Problem : From 2015 to 2017, hotels experienced a high number of booking cancellations, both at Resort Hotels and City Hotels. This situation could lead to a reduction in potential revenue from non-room services, such as food and special requests from guests, including room service and cleaning.

The analysis will be conducted to answer the following questions:

What was the portion of booking cancellations for each hotel?
What country has the highest booking cancellation rate?
Did the frequency of cancellations increase year over year?
How has the ADR fluctuated between bookings and cancelatons?
Which hotel was more profitable and experienced fewer booking cancelations?
When was the peak booking season for each hotel type?
Did lead time affect booking cancellations?
Was there any correlation between deposit type and booking cancellations?
Did meals and special requests affect ADR?
Did booking cancellations impact the hotel's potential revenue loss?
